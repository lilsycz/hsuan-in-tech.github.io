  <!-- 1. Why I want this program (≤250 chars) -->
  <article>
    <h3>1) Why this program</h3>
    <p>
      With a background in architecture & game, I want a structured, inclusive path into IT. I am really into the program's practical programming courses and project work that prepares me for an entry-level tech role. It will help me expand my skills into web and software development, which will bring me opportunities to become a full-stack developer/game developer and fulfill my dream.

  <!-- 2. Why I believe I can become an excellent developer (≤250 chars) -->
  <article>
    <h3>2) Why I will do well</h3>
    <p>
      I am disciplined, fast-learning, and detail-oriented. I have shipped complex studio projects and documented my process. I have experience in programming using Python and C# while working on my previous projects, and I really enjoyed solving problems, as well as learning and applying new tech in my work. In addition, I'll have my full attention to the courses since I recently finished my Master's and am committed to having a career boost through this program. I am very much looking forward to the new skills I'll learn and shaping the path of my life step by step from here.

    <h3>3) Personal letter</h3>
    <p>
     I’ve always appreciated how my studies in architecture and game art have shaped both my creativity and my sense of structure. Designing spaces and building interactive worlds taught me how composition, color, and rhythm can guide emotion. At the same time, technology has always been another deep passion of mine — a field where ideas become systems that people can explore and connect with.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As I began learning programming, I discovered how satisfying it is to create through logic. It gives me the same focus I used to find in long design sessions — learning independently, solving problems step by step, and seeing my work take form. I enjoy that feeling of autonomy: researching, building, and improving until something works beautifully.
    </p>

    <p>
    Front-end development feels like the natural bridge between my creative foundation and my technical curiosity. It allows me to combine design thinking, spatial reasoning, and analytical structure to build something both functional and expressive. I’m also fascinated by how front-end and back-end development connect to form one coherent system, and I want to understand that full process. My goal is to grow into a full-stack developer who can design both the structure and the experience of a product.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I’m eager to keep learning in an environment that values collaboration, inclusion, and curiosity. This program represents a chance to strengthen my technical foundation, enhance my independence as a creator, and transform my artistic background into solid developer skills. I hope to keep growing toward becoming a confident, versatile software engineer who can create with both creativity and precision.
    </p>

  <article>
    <h3>4) Other information</h3>
    <p>
      I’m available for remote/onsite study, have a reliable laptop and stable internet, and can commit to deadlines. English is fluent; Swedish is in progress. I’m motivated to practice daily and support classmates.
